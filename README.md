## About the Project
Conscious Shopper is easy to use app that will let customers and business owners search, review, vote and share small family and minority owned businesses in their area.  This app is an SPA powered by MERN.

All customers will be able to search based on:
* Location
* Business type
* Status (small, family, minority, going out of business) 
    
Once the customer finds a desired business he/she will be able to view important information such as address, operation hours, listings, menu and share it.  Consumers will be able to leave comments and vote on businesses.

All business owners who purchase a business account will be able to add their business to the Conscious Shopper database including:
* Images
* Location
* Listing
* Operating hours

Business owners will be able to view comments about their business and respond to their consumers.
